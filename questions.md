##Questions about SecureWitness Vision Statement


###paragraph 1

Any restrictions on the type or format of the "information"/documents that will be stored on the server?


###paragraph 2

Are we making the assumption that the server encrypts immediately after receiving the files? If the files are not encrypted locally before uploading, we cannot guarantee that a malicious or compromised server would not get access to them, in violation of the project's goals.

Should users be able to view the support files on the server, or will they just be stored there?

Can one user act as both author and reader, or does an account have to be of one type or the other? Could an account be of either or both types at once?

Can access to documents be revoked after an author has given a reader access?

Can individual private documents be given access to separately, or must an author give a reader access to all or none of her documents at once?

In making information about the author of a public bulletin secure, what information about the poster should be included or hidden?


###paragraph 3

Are there any constraints on how the documents should be encrypted?

Must all documents in a bulletin be encrypted or unencrypted together, or may that determination be made separately for each document?


###paragraph 4

Will there only be one level of folder, or will the folders be able to make a complete directory structure with folders within folders? What does it mean to (and what is the utility of being able to) copy a bulletin (esp if they can't be edited later)?


###paragraph 5

Will data that a reader has been given special permission to access appear with other search results, or will there be some other way to access this data?


###paragraph 6

what are the specific powers of the administrator? It would seem that any manipulation of user files would violate the security goals of the project.

How are administrator accounts created?

Are administrators also regular users?

What should be the process for a user to create an account?

##etc
Can readers download documents? If yes, will they download the encrypted or decrypted version?
